# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
In this project, a CSV file containing election data was analyzed to determine election results. Using Python to analyze election data, the following results were determined:

  1. The total number of votes cast.
  2. The number of votes received by each candidate.
  3. The percentage of votes received by each candidate.
  4. The winner of the election based on the popular vote. 

### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to automate election data using Python, to sort data and generate results.

## Resources
Data Source: election_results.csv
Software: Python 3.10.2 VS code 1.64.2
