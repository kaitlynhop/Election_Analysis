# Election Audit

## Overview of Election Audit
In this project, a CSV file containing election data was analyzed to determine election results. Using Python to analyze election data, the following results were determined:

  1. The total number of votes cast.
  2. The number of votes received by each candidate.
  3. The percentage of votes received by each candidate.
  4. The winner of the election based on the popular vote. 
  5. Voter turnout based on county.
  6. Percentages of votes from each county.
  7. The county with the highest voter turnout. 

### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to automate election data using Python, to quickly sort and generate results.
